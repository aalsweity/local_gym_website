        <div>
          <p>If you wanna get fit the right way, then you need to show commitment and start healthy habbits!</p>

            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p><strong>Commit to a healthy eating style.</strong><br>
               If you think you're gonna lose weight or get fit by gyming and eating junk, then think again!<br>
              Because eating junk and exercising only cancels each other out so that you gain absolutely nothing! Also, maybe some more weight.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p><strong>Commit to gym for real!</strong><br>
              Now that you got your junk food in the garbage, it's time to hit the gym everyday at least 1 hour a day!<br>
              It doesn't matter if you can't run for an hour. Just doing some exercising for at least 1 hour is all you need to start a healthy gym life!

            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p><strong>Staying Commited till you reach your goal and beyond!</strong><br>
              Once you have mastered the first 2 steps, step 3 should be a breeze!<br>
              Simply keep coming everyday and push it to the limit!<br>
              When you feel even more stronger and energetic, you may even decided to hit the gym twice a day instead of once. In the end, it depends on you!<br>
              So come on over and hit the gym with your gym partners and work together in achieving your goal!
